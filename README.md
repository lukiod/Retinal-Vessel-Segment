👁️ Retinal Vessel Segmentation 🔍 '/n'
This project brings 💡 deep learning to medical imaging by accurately segmenting retinal vessels from fundus images, enabling precise 👌 diagnosis and monitoring of eye diseases. Get ready for an awesome 🚀 user experience with two GUI options!
🌟 Features

💻 Tkinter GUI: Simple and intuitive interface for uploading and visualizing segmentation results.
🌐 Streamlit GUI: Interactive and modern GUI with real-time image processing.
🧠 Deep Learning Models: State-of-the-art algorithms for accurate segmentation.
🤖 Ensemble Modeling: Combining multiple models for improved performance.

🚀 Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/your-username/retinal-vessel-segmentation.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the GUI:

Tkinter: python tkinter_gui.py
Streamlit: streamlit run streamlit_gui.py



📂 Dataset
Trained on the DRIVE dataset of fundus images with manual labels. 📈
🔭 Future Aspects

📥 Integrate new deep learning architectures.
🌐 Web-based deployment for wider accessibility.
📡 Support for other medical imaging modalities.
